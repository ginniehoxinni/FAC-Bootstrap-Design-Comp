We are both a cultural and a learning precinct situated in Walyalup (Fremantle) on Whadjuk Nyoongar Boodjar in the centre of a city celebrated for its innovation, culture and creativity, shaped by the many communities who call it home.

Spread over a four-acre site and housed in a gothic heritage building, our annual program includes contemporary visual arts exhibitions and a diverse range of multidisciplinary performance, music and discourse. We support a unique artist in residence program, extensive creative learning programs and we are home to a café and our FOUND shop – celebrating the highest quality creations of WA makers and designers. We also manage and curate the Moores Building Contemporary Arts Space in the West End of Fremantle.
FAC’s commitment to supporting local artists is at the heart of all the centre’s programming and activities.
